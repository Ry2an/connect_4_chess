# README FILE OF CONNECT FOUR CHESS
## Game Author: Ruoyan Han (Ry2an)

Hi There!

Thank you for viewing this page.

I created a connect four game based on R, R ggplot2 and R shiny.

To play the game, please make sure your computer have following environment:

+ ** R software 3.6.1 or above**

+ ** R studio (most recent update)**

+ ** package "ggplot2" and "shiny" are installed in R**

*If you do not have these two packages, you can run the enviroment.R to install.*

After you clone this reprository to your local system, open **launcher.R** with R studio and run the script.

Then you can play the game locally with another player.

Hope my little project could bring your childhood memory back. Please Enjoy!

Sincerely,

Ruoyan Han
